What is a hero?
What about that poor woman?
Strong men also cry

Child at a movie
Series of victimless crimes
Who's the nihilist?

Your mortal remains
A check for sixty nine cents
Where do I fit in?

Yes that's your answer
Your answer to everything
Lost my train of thought

Your mortal remains
Entering a world of pain
That isn't legal either

Jesus, what's that smell?
First Lady of the nation
Dude, we just don't know

Unchecked aggression
You're gonna kill your father
Those are good burgers

Viva Las Vegas
Strikes and gutters, ups and downs
Take it easy, man

Sex, do you like it?
The preferred nomenclature
Yes that's your answer

A crack on the jaw
What I'm blathering about
The brevity thing

There's a beverage
A helluva caucasian
Was not his to give

Change the channel man
Not something to hide behind
Most modestly priced

There's a beverage
A helluva caucasian
Most modestly priced

Please slide your shorts down
Take any rug in the house
Troubles are over

Jesus, what's that smell?
Your answer to everything
Dude, we just don't know

Lotta what-have-yous
They've got us working in shifts
Kill your fucking car

Your phone's ringing dude
The bosom of the ocean
He was one of us

Put away the gun
Compulsively, without joy
Strongly vaginal

Child at a movie
I lost a little money
Fuck it, let's go bowl

Lost my train of thought
I lost a little money
Fuck it, let's go bowl

Nihilists? Jesus.
That had not occurred to us
It's down there somewhere

I am the walrus
Look for who will benefit
I am the walrus

So many cuss words
Down through the generations
Surprised at my tears
